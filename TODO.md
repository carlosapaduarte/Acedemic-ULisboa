This is a list of task that we planned along the way, based on weekly meetings, but did not get the chance to implement/finish:

## 1. Create New Task  

- Tags are only highlighted with a specific color when selected. Otherwise, they appear brown. Maybe use borders to distinguish selected tags.  
- Maybe open a sidebar when creating an event on the calendar.  
- Implement the operation to delete an event on the calendar page.  
- Style the calendar.  
- Design the Pomodoro timer.

## 2. On the task list page

- When clicking on tasks, make completed tasks disappear (only show incomplete tasks).  
- When clicking on a task to mark it as complete, make it disappear after 5 seconds.  
- Show tasks without deadlines at the end.  
- Missing badges in the challenge: make them for both at the same time, after the statistics.  
- Have a weekly reminder to update.  
- Add other interesting features to the homepage, such as quick access to statistics, tasks, etc.

## 3. Task management

- Add a button to create a new tag and transition to a sidebar menu.  
- Add an arrow next to the tag to select TAG status. Implement a selector by Friday.  
- In the task list view, add a button: "ALL," to define sorting by priority or deadline.  
- When checking the parent task, check all its subtasks.  
- Make the parent task more opaque when it inherits the priority of its child task.

## 4. Subtask and task rules

- Never repeat subtasks on the same day.  
- Provide a way to click the checkbox to select the state.  
- Provide a way to show the state in the task list (state is not just complete or incomplete).

## 5. Tags and user management

- There should be a defined set of tags. Users can create new tags later.

## 6. Task creation and authentication

- Add an icon to delete a "Slot To Work" on create task.  
- Add a button to create a new tag.  
- Implement basic authentication (store only hash with salt).

## 7. Challenge completion

- To uncomplete a challenge, require a confirmation box, with no option to undo.

## 8. Academic Challenge 

- Add dates to challenges (navigation between challenge sets).  
- Badges and medals in English.

## 9. Authentication

- Have an option during authentication to ask if the user had an account previously, and if so, request credentials to transfer data from the other account.  
- Display the DGES logo with the highest priority.

## 10. Energy level selection

- Add another face in the energy level selector: a face with a straight mouth (intermediate level).  
- Avoid global errors.  
- Only have one level of subtask. A subtask is not another task.  
- Add a button to switch between the two frontends: it could be a dropdown with options for logout, settings, and switching apps. This button could even be the current settings button (the gear icon).

## 11. App navigation

- The gear button on the app bar opens a dropdown, where we can logout, navigate to the Academic main page, and go to the settings page.

## 12. Calendar features

- Add a checkmark in the corner of the day on the calendar.  
- In the calendar, when clicking on a challenge, show the notes first.  
- Add a button for the note history in challenge 3.  
- Remove the progress wheel from challenge 3?
